/**********************************************************************
 *
 * purpose: an AJAX interface to Pywps
 *
 * authors: Luca Casagrande (...) and Lorenzo Becchi (lorenzo@ominiverdi.com)
 *
 *   - it should work like this (jachym suggestion): 
 *		1) user will set the server address 
 *		2) webinterface would getcapabilities - all the processes offered by the server 
 * 		3) user would choose some process 
 * 		4) web interface would describe process and create input form for the user
 * 
 *   TODO:
 * 		- tranlate all comments in english
 * 		- stick to the planned interface
