After a year of development, Python Web Processing Service (PyWPS) 2.0.0
is new stable release, which fixes number of bugs and instabilities in
previous 1.0.0 version, as well as adds new functionality. 
</p>
<p>
PyWPS implements OGC Web Processing Service 0.4.0 standard [1]. It is
developed with native support for GRASS GIS [2], however, it can be used
with other GIS command line tools  too (PROJ, GDAL/OGR, ...), as well as
with the R Project for Statistical Computing. 
</p>
<p>
OGC Web Processing Service specification provides client access across a
network to pre-programmed calculations and/or computation models that
operate on spatially referenced data. The calculation can be extremely
simple or highly complex, with any number of data inputs and outputs. It
does not specify the specific processes that could be implemented by a
WPS. Instead, it specifies a generic mechanism that can be used to
describe and web-enable any sort of geospatial process. 
</p>
<p>
Several client applications can be used with PyWPS, e.g. Embrio project
[3] and there is also plugin for OpenLayers [4][5].
</p>
<p>
Major changes:
<ul>
<li>New Process interface for easier coding</li>
<li>More stable, temporary files should be deleted in any case</li>
<li>More verbose, better debugging output</li>
<li>OGC WPS 0.4.0 still not fully implemented, but much more</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
New development should be focused at implementation of the OGC WPS 1.0.0
specification.
