This program is simple implementation of OGS's [http://opengeospatial.org]
Web Processing Service (OpenGIS(r) Web Processing Service - OGC 05-007r4)
version 0.4.0 from 2005-09-16

Target of this application is to bring functionality of GIS GRASS
[http://grass.itc.it] to the World Wide Web - it should work like
wrapper for modules of this GIS. Though GRASS was at the first place in the
focuse, it is not necessery to use it's modules - you can use any program
you can script in Python or other language.

This first version was written with support of Deutsche Bundesstiftung
Umwelt, Osnabrueck, Germany on the spring 2006. SVN server is hosted by
GDF-Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

For setting see comments in 'etc' directory and documentation.

Enjoy and happy GISing!
