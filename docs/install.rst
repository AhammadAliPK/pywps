Installation
============

To install PyWPS you need Python 2.7, 3.3 or newer. PyWPS-4 is under
development and there is no stable release yet. The only way to install
is from the source repository::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/jachym/pywps-4.git@master#egg=pywps-dev

This automatically installs the dependencies, `lxml` and `werkzeug`.
