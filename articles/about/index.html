<h3><a name="about" id="about">About</a></h3>
<p>PyWPS <em>(Python Web Processing Service)</em> is implementation
of <a href=
"http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/requests/28">Web
Processing Service</a> standard from <a href=
"http://opengeospatial.org">Open Geospatial Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>It has been started on Mai 2006 as project supported by <a href=
"http://dbu.de">DBU</a>. It offers environment for programming own
process (geofunctions or models) which can be accessed from the
public. The main advantage of PyWPS is, that it has been written
with native support for <a href="http://grass.itc.it">GRASS</a>.
Access GRASS modules via web interace should be as easy as
possible.</p>
<p>Processes can be written using GRASS GIS, but usage of other
programs is also possible. Usage together with <a href=
"http://r-project.org">R</a> package or <a href=
"http://remotesensing.org/gdal/">GDAL</a> or <a href=
"http://proj.maptools.org/">PROJ</a> tools.</p>
<p>PyWPS is written in <a href="http://python.org">Python
programming language</a>, your processes must use this language
too.</p>

<h3><a name="history" id="history">History</a></h3>
<p>PyWPS has been initialy started by <a href=
"http://les-ejk.cz">Jachym Cepicky</a> as his project ,,Connecting
of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer`` for German <a href=
"http://dbu.de">Foundation for Environment</a>. Be began to work on
this project from April 2006 to September 2006, while he was on his
sholarship by <a href="http://gdf-hannover.de">GDF-Hannover
GmbH</a> company.</p>
<p>First site, which has adopted PyWPS as demo application was
<a href="http://www.bnhelp.cz/mapserv/wpsdemo/index.php">WPS
Demo</a> provided by <a href="http://www.bnhelp.cz">Help Service
Remote Sensing</a> company.</p>
<p>First presentation about PyWPS was held at <a href=
"http://foss4g2006.org">FOSS4G 2006</a> conference in Lausanne.
It's name was <a href=
"http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=67&amp;sessionId=48&amp;confId=1">
GRASS goes web: PyWPS</a>.</p>
<p>Around October 2006, the project homepage has been moved from
Jachym's personal homepage to GForge server hosted on <a href=
"http://wald.intevation.org">wald.intevation.org</a>, which is
maintained by <a href="http://intevation.org">Intevation GmbH</a>
company to support their projects. Since this date, PyWPS has it's
own mailing lists, subversion repository and other necessary
infrastructure for Open Source project.</p>
<p>In October 2006, other developers joined the development, so
that it is possible to speak about <a href="/development/">PyWPS
Development Team</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2006-11-10</strong> version 1.0.0 has been released.</p>
<p>During November 2006, Lorenzo Becchi and Luca Casagrande started
their work on Web User Interface for WPS. They lunched two
projects: <a href="http://pywps.ominiverdi.org">WUIW and
Embrio</a>. WUIW should be general web interace able to handle any
WPS server. Embrio is bringing functionality of <a href=
"http://grass.itc.it">GRASS GIS</a> to the Internet. WUIW and
Embrio are part of PyWPS's subversion repository.</p>
<p><strong>2007-10-08</strong> version 2.0.0 has been released.</p>
<p>New version improved stability, approached in the standard
implementation and introduces python Class <code>Process</code>,
which's methods can be used in process coding. New WPS client
project was lounched, plugin for <a href=
"http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>.</p>
