The fork & pull request approach (patches)
******************************************
PyWPS uses the commonly fork&pull request development method. Very short:

#. You fork your own repository of PyWPS https://github.com/geopython/PyWPS/fork_select

#. You work in this repository, make changes etc.

#. Once you are done, you make Pull request

#. The discussion about your pull request will happen at github https://github.com/geopython/PyWPS/pulls

The whole approach is described nicely
